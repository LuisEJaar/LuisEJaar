To hear my story: 

Born in a small town, my beginnings are rather quaint and humble. I attended Mississippi State University where I received my degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2010. While in college I did a number of jobs including Engineering Research, Resident Adviser, Co-Op rotations, and even being a model for art classes. Upon graduation I felt that I was drawn towards coding but decided to try and use the degree that I had worked so hard for. My Engineering career was certainly an interesting one which allowed me to design custom jet interiors at Dassault Falcon Jet and write instruction for aircraft repair with AIRBUS on top of traveling to some interesting places. Ultimately my desire to code won and I started on my journey of teaching myself a new field. While choosing to leave a prosperous career to pursue my passion was and still can be truly daunting, I beleived in myself enough to take the jump and know that I have made the right choice. I found a group called #100Devs after a few months of self study and have been engaged with them ever since.
